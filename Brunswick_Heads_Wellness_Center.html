    <h4>Site & Social Background</h4>
    <p class="p1">
        Brunswick Heads is a small, coastal village on the NSW north coast. Brunswick Head has al strong community
        culture.
        There are lots of sports-related community groups such as Triathlon, Surfing, Softball, and tennis. It is worth
        noting, that most of these sports are not suitable for the orders in this town. In an aging society, the
        Middle-aged
        and elderly people also created community groups to build relationships with each other. </p>
    <h4>Key Concept</h4>
    <p class="p1">
        Humans are not free-standing isolated individuals, we are all members of each other. Life’s simple pleasures
        come
        from lasting meaningful relationships with others such as family, friends, and communities. People suffice to
        live
        in a well-grounded community with a common culture and moral infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p class="p1">
        The design vision for the Brunswick Heads Wellness Center is to create a space for a walking club in Brunswick
        Heads. Walking is a super-inclusive exercise that everyone can participate in. Walking exercise does not require
        skills and has a low impact on the body. This democratic form of body practice and exercise build culturally on
        Brunswick Heads’ old people’s condition. The reality of Brunswick Heads and its condition does not allow
        collectivity of body wellness practice to exist. The aging people in rural Australia find themselves lost of
        community and lost of access to sporting club activities. The wellness center will reinforce a community culture
        of
        mutual support and caring, enhance their well-being and improve their quality of life. The elders will be
        encouraged
        to take collective activities and integrate with different age groups more meaningfully and socially.
    </p>
    <h4>Typology</h4>
    <p class="p1">
        This project is a hybrid public wellness center. At its facilities, the residents, especially the elders are
        offered
        a platform for a Walking Club as well as a variety of recreational activities and wellness practices such as
        Yoga,
        collective dancing and sports installations.
