<h1 class="me" id="me"> About Me </h1>
<p class="p1"> I
    am Jinhao Lu, an architect who graduated from the University of Melbourne in Bachelor of Architecture. I am
    self-driven and willing to dabble in different fields. I have accumulated various architecture types,
    knowledge, and design experience. For example library, collective housing, terraced house, parametric design, and
    landscape design. I am skilled in multiple design software including Rhino, Enscape, Adobe, CAD, etc. I believe in
    the power of holistically good ideas
    paired with logic derivation. I am passionate about humanistic architecture
    that also connects to the environment. </p>

    projects collections, CV, and contact information to attract potential client and architecture firms.
    JinhaoLuPortfolio.com will provide a clear classification of works in terms of programmatic and chronological. </p>

<h1 class="me" id="mySite">About My Site</h1>
<p class="p2"> Building the website by myself helps me form a more comprehensive understanding about website design. I
    realized designing the webpage is quite different from doing graphic design using illustrator or InDesign. While
    using html and CSS, every element needs to be given a precise value such as the width, height, margin, and padding.
    Moreover, designing a webpage also need to consider the final effect in different sizes of screens, which means I
    should always work with proportions rather than pixels.</p>
<br/>
<p class="p2">Furthermore, there are something I would done different if I realized earlier. As for the CSS, I used to
    create a
    different CSS file for different components in a webpage such as the navbar, the main body, the image part. However,
    I found there will be conflicts if two CSS files mention the same component. This brought me a lot of troubles to
    figure out which file should I change. I will minimize the CSS file and use class and id to identify different
    elements in the future. As for the gallery part, if I had realized earlier, I would use images with lower resolution
    as a thumbnail image rather than the original image to make the page loading faster.</p>
